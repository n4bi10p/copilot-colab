# Demo Script (Bhumi)

## 3-5 Minute Walkthrough

1. Sign in as Owner (User A) and Member (User B) in two VS Code windows.
2. Owner creates a project, invites Member.
3. Member joins, both interact with tasks, chat, and presence.
4. Show dashboard: task counts, recent messages, online users.
5. Change task status, send messages, toggle presence—show real-time sync.
6. Owner removes Member, verify access revoked.
7. Show fallback: if realtime or AI fails, demo static data and explain.

## Speaker Sequence
- Owner: project creation, invite, dashboard
- Member: join, interact, test removal
- Both: test real-time sync, dashboard updates

## Fallback Path
- If realtime fails: refresh, show static data, explain expected behavior
- If AI fails: show last successful output, explain expected result
